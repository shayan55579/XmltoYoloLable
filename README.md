# XmltoYoloLable

The XML to YOLO label conversion format is commonly used for object detection tasks. It involves extracting relevant information from XML annotations and converting it into YOLO format for training or inference. The following fields are included in the label:

- **Class**: The class or category of the object present in the image.
- **Width**: The width of the image in pixels.
- **Height**: The height of the image in pixels.
- **Bounding Box Coordinates**: The coordinates of the bounding box that encloses the object, usually defined as the top-left corner coordinates (x1, y1) and the bottom-right corner coordinates (x2, y2).

Example YOLO label format:


To save the label for future work, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a text file with the `.txt` extension (e.g., `image1.txt`) for each corresponding image.
2. Store the YOLO label information in the text file, one label per line, following the YOLO label format.
3. Ensure that the text file is saved in the same directory as the corresponding image.

By following this format and saving the labels in separate text files, you can easily reference and use them for future training or inference tasks.

Remember to adjust the label format and content according to your specific requirements or any variations you may be using in your project.
